# End-to-End-Customer-Churn-Analysis
End-to-end Customer Churn Analysis project using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI — covering data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and interactive dashboard creation to track churn rate, retention, and revenue loss insights.
📊 Overview

This project is a complete end-to-end Customer Churn Analysis pipeline built using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.
It analyzes customer behavior, calculates churn and retention metrics, and visualizes actionable insights to reduce churn and improve retention.

🚀 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Extraction

Collected raw customer data from SQL database.

Imported and verified using SQL queries for consistency and accuracy.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python + Excel)

Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data wrangling and handling missing values.

Performed data validation, formatting, and derived columns in Excel for business-friendly representation.

3️⃣ Data Analysis (SQL & Python)

Calculated Churn Rate, Retention Rate, Revenue Loss due to Churn, and Customer Segmentation.

SQL used for aggregations and joins; Python used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical summaries.

4️⃣ Visualization (Power BI)

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to showcase key insights:
